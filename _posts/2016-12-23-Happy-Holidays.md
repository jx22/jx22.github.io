Happy holidays from all of us at Project Castle. Thanks for sticking with us, we think 2017 will be even more exciting.

But while we're still here in 2016, we'd like to provide you with a special gift.

Yes, that's right! A special gift!

What's that you ask? Is there a catch?

Yes. 

There is a catch. We have limited supply of the special gift. And so we must take steps to only provide it to some of you.

Which of you are eligible, you ask?

Well, we can only give out the special gift to people whose name begins with the letter L. We apologize for any confusion this may cause.

What is the special gift, you ask?

To find out please visit <a href="http://bit.ly/2he6kDZ">this website</a>.

How will you receive your special gift? We will provide those details if you <a href="mailto:inquiries@projectcastle.net">contact us</a> with proof of your eligibility.

Thank you again for following us. See you in 2017!
