Oh, ho, ho, has it been a while on this blog! We've forgotten how to blog! Well, almost. . . . 

It turns out that we've been busy. Big surprise, yeah, we know. But seriously! Lots of projects, lots of ideas for new projects, and certainly lots of foosball. Just the way things are around here. We like it.

But hey, we've got some things to cover today. So let's not bury the lead. 

### Corporate announcement

First, we want to let everyone know about a high-level development. Project Castle has recently (as in this quarter) taken on an initial funding round totaling $10 million. We'll be investing the lion's share of the money in the way that makes sense to us: R&D. We have no marketing function. We currently have no sales function. And no, we are not bringing in new leadership.

We believe in solidifying our foundation as a group that thinks up what's next, and then sets out to build it. We're proud to say that that message is starting to resonate in the venture capital community.

We want to give a big shout out to our new investor, but the firm has some prominent backers and as such has asked us to keep its identity secret for now. But please know that as a going concern, Project Castle is here to stay, and now a representative from the firm has joined the board to help the company keep moving in the right direction. Woo! We're excited. There's so much to do. . . .

### New group

Next up, we want to let everyone know something new that we're doing as a company. In the spirit of investing deeply in the research and development phase, and <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/8769863">specifically the "research" part of the term "research and development,"</a> we have recently gone ahead and formed a new wing. We call it the Project Castle Advanced Research Program, or PCARP. 

<h2>PCARP</h2>

We are hopeful that this new unit will bring about truly inspiring technologies, processes, products and ideas, leaving the rest of the company to focus its energy on core project work. We have tasked one of our first team members, Jane de Luca, with leading PCARP. In discussions with our leadership team, Jane made it clear that it was important to expand the organization slowly and carefully, and so to ensure the success of the research group, we have decided to establish the PCARP School. We hope to publish more on the PCARP School in the future.

### Post update

Looking back at 2017, the company has continued to innovate and iterate on a number of fronts. But the team agrees that if there's any achievement that's bigger than any other, it's got to be the introduction of our first project, that being of course <a href="http://www.projectcastle.net/blog/2017/04/26/Meet-Post">Post</a>. 

We're happy to see that the concept has been well received -- the usage of Post absolutely reflects that. And so the team has decided to make an extension to Post.

What does this mean? A few things. First, this means that the service will remain available and will not be discontinued at the end of this year. There had been some discussion about sunsetting Post and putting more of our resources on other projects, but we've decided to stay the course. After all, as our first-ever project, Post has significance for us. And hey, we have more money now! We can do what we want! 

The second thing we want to point out here is that certain people may have received messages or other information through Post and have then used Post to send information, and the extension of Post means that all previously relayed messages remain valid, unless otherwise noted. People will continue to be able to send messages through Post if and when they need to, at least through the end of 2018. So if further messages need to be sent over a reliable system like Post, that can indeed be done. We thank our engineering team for their inspiring dedication to the project. 

Thanks as always for following us here at Project Castle, and happy holidays!
