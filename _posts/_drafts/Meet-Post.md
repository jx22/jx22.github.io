Yes, that's right! We have some news. ... It's about ... <em>drum roll, please!</em>

<h1>a new project!</h1>

Yes, that's right, everyone, we do have a new project. And it is huge. It is exciting. For us, anyway. As you know, we have been very quiet about what we have been working on, and each of our projects is truly fascinating, and this is of course a very special day because it marks the public launch of our first project! That's a big deal for all of us here at Project Castle!

Thank you for being patient with us all along. We know many of you have been wondering what we're up to.

So, uh, well, um, do you know want to know what it is? 

Of course you do!

So I'll tell you!
