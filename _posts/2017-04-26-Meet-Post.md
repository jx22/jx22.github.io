Yes, that's right! We have some news. ... It's about ... <em>drum roll, please!</em>

## A new project!

Yes, that's right, everyone, we do have a new project. And it is huge. It is exciting. For us, anyway. As you know, we have been very quiet about what we have been working on, and each of our projects is truly fascinating, and this is of course a very special day because it marks the public launch of our first project! That's a big deal for all of us here at Project Castle!

Thank you for being patient with us all along. We know many of you have been wondering what we're up to.

So, uh, well, um, do you know want to know what it is? 

Of course you do!

So we'll tell you!

# POST

It is **Post**. Post is a system that takes its inspiration from formal institutions that can be counted on to work, no matter what. Some systems that meet these parameters are the international postal system (just how does a letter go from a place in one country to a place in another country?), major airlines, AM radio, and ugly but commercial-ready vehicles like the Toyota Van from the mid-1980s.

In our case, Post is a system for delivering information, simply and reliably, and then accepting new information. Of course, this being a project from us here at Project Castle, this is not meant for others to use in production. But we are experimenting with it. We are hopeful that it will be useful for the world, which is why we are releasing this project into the wild after months of incubation.

Before you check out the project for yourself, we want to let you know that the information in Post might not make sense at first. But we ask that you look carefully and try to grasp the message with its small amount of information, and then follow the instructions. Thank you very much in advance. By the way, if you have any qu.estions, as always, please feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:inquiries@projectcastle.net">inquiries@projectcastle.net</a>
