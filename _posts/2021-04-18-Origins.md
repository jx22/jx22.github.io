We know it's been a while. We know. 

### Team update

P.C. battened down the hatches last year as the coronavirus came to America, like so many other groups. We prioritized the safety of the team, because there would be no projects without the team, and we didn't want to unnecessarily burden the hospitals. Our team members went home and we adopted the online tools of the day. The nature of our work is such that on-site collaboration and creation is important, and so we did what we could as we distributed. Happily, our researchers and engineers have been productive in this phase, posing new questions and pursuing small-scale initiatives. We fully intend to return to our facilities. We have surveyed our team and the majority grasp the value of coming together in person and are looking forward to doing so again.

In the way of organizational updates, we would like to recognize a few members of our staff as they take on new positions.

First, effective immediately, <b>Dot Giroux</b>, our project coordinator for the past six years and a person we have all come to rely for everything from onboarding to partnerships, from logistical support to quality assurance -- and she helped the team adopt its distributed structure last year -- is stepping into a new role that better represents how essential she is to our mission. As chief operating officer, Dot will oversee go-to-market work, along with our increasingly important finance function that ensures we can continue to do what we do. We congratulate Dot as she begins this new chapter as a member of our central committee.

Second, <b>Brian Eggers</b>, one of our outreach specialists who joined in 2016, will be taking over for Dot as our new project coordinator. Brian is highly thought of among people who have engaged with Project Castle on Post, and we are confident that Brian is more than ready to take on this broader role. He will report to Dot.

### New work

This once-in-a-lifetime period has given birth to two new, related initiatives that we are excited today to unveil.

<h2>Grid</h2>

Before setting up our facilities in California, Project Castle had been completely based out of a small office in New York. The size of the office made some projects challenging as they grew beyond the conception stage. 

To honor our heritage, we are offering up Grid. It brings to the fore some of the important places in our development, on a grand map of New York. 

The name "Grid" pays homage to the grid system employed across broad swaths of the city. We honor the forethought that went into the planning of the city to aid in navigation.

<a href="https://www.projectcastle.net/grid/">Grid</a> on its own is not especially engaging in terms of providing a means for our users to specify their own special places on the map. For the reason, we are introducing a second initiative concurrent with Grid.

<h2>Landmark Creation Service</h2>

The <a href="https://www.projectcastle.net/grid/landmark">Landmark Creation Service</a> provides a means of quickly entering and deleting information about our users' own landmarks. Our outreach specialists will assist in the development of custom maps just like Grid. We expect that users might wish to include some of the locations entered into Grid on their own maps, along with additional places. 

Please note that, for technical reasons, there is an accelerated timeline of end of support for Grid and the Landmark Creation Service. Both will go offline on May 1, 2021, so we encourage users to use them extensively while they remain available. Brian Eggers has been supporting the development of both of these new initiatives for the past few months and is <a href="mailto:brian@projectcastle.net">available by email</a> to answer questions.

We look forward to announcing more permanent projects in the future.
